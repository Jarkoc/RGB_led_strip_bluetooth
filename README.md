ArduDroid: A Simple 2-Way Bluetooth-based Android Controller for Arduino RGB led strip

INTRODUCTION

GET IT ON google PLAY "ardudroid" app

ARDUDROID (formerly Andruino) is a simple Android app to help you control the pins of your Arduino Uno (or clone) from your Android phone wirelessly. It's both an Android app and an Arduino program. ArduDroid employs a simple Android user interface to 1) control Arduino Uno's digital and PWM pins 2) send text commands to Arduino 3) and receive data from Arduino over Bluetooth serial using the ever popular and really cheap (less than $10 from ebay) HC-05 Bluetooth over serial module.This app has been tested and designed for the HC-05 Serial Bluetooth module. Other Bluetooth modules may or may not work. Also, while I used Arduino Uno in this prototype, feel free to experiment with other models of Arduino. I have published a guide before on building and programming a circuit with the HC-05 Bluetooth module and Arduino but I will briefly describe again in this guide how to wire the circuit using a breadboard and jumper wires.Special thanks to engineer Jafar Quttaineh for testing the app and for his invaluable input.

How to use ArduDroid


You can use ArduDroid to send commands to Arduino to control a relay to turn electric gadgets on/off, control a robot servo, increase/decrease speed of a motor and reverse direction, dim a light, speed up a fan, and so on. Furthermore, you can read Arduino pins and sensors then transmit the data back to your android phone.
